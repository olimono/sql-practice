This is my SQL and data modeling practice as part of the KC Big Data and Data Analysis bootcamp. 

We had to model a database with its entity relationship diagram for an insurance company. Create the tables in SQL and fill them in with an SQL script. Finally we had to add a query to check the full info of the active cars. 

Thanks for reading!
